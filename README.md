# Seattle Crime Analysis

### Abstract
This project aims to visualize temporal and spatial trends of criminal activity in Seattle via data collection and cleaning. Additionally, the project includes a real-life application of statistical hypothesistesting based on true crime incidence. The process of analyzing two-sample proportions will be introduced in order to draw meaningful conclusions from data. Results will be used to evaluate the reliability ofinformation found on an online source.


### Data Collection
The crime dataset is from the City of Seattle Open Data portal spanning from 2015 to 2020. The dataset consists of basic identifying information about the crime incident, such as date/time when the crime happened, block where the crime occurred, crime category, location description, and location coordinates. 

According to the data.seattle.gov, the dataset is provided by Seattle Police Department (SPD). To preserve data quality, SPD relied on the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS). Data is updated once every twenty-four hours; thus, the quality of the SPD can be assumed to be reasonably high. SPD have also provided a detailed description of the sources of the data and how they were processed. The enclosed data dictionary contains descriptions of all variables in the dataset. In addition, the data were assembled manually, so there is always the possibility for human error. Given the public nature of the data, we would be able to consult the original data sources to check the quality of the data if we had any questions. 


### Acknowledgement
I would like to express my great appreciation to Dr. Sloughter, who guided me throughout this project. This project could not be completed without his valuable support and constructive feedback.
